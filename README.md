## 1. Sales Performance Dashboard

**BizSight: Sales, Profit & Regional Insights Dashboard**

An interactive Power BI dashboard that uncovers sales trends, profitability patterns, and regional performance to empower businesses with data-backed decision-making.

## 2. Short Description / Purpose

The **Sales Performance Dashboard** is a visually engaging and analytics-driven Power BI report designed to help sales managers, analysts, and executives monitor business performance across products, categories, and regions. It focuses on key commercial KPIs such as total sales, profit, profit margin, and order volume while providing a deeper understanding of customer segments and product performance. The dashboard enables stakeholders to identify growth opportunities, optimize product strategies, and improve profitability.

## 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

* **Power BI Desktop** – Main platform for designing interactive dashboards.
* **Power Query** – For data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – To create calculated metrics, dynamic measures, and interactive visuals.

## 4. Data Source

**Example:**
Source: [Sample Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) – A dataset containing order-level sales transactions.
Data includes product details, sales amounts, profit, discount, order dates, shipping modes, regions, and customer segments.


## 5. Features / Highlights

**Business problem**
Businesses often lack a consolidated, visual approach to track sales performance, analyze profitability, and identify underperforming products or regions.

**Goal of the dashboard**
To provide decision-makers with a centralized, interactive tool that gives a 360° view of sales performance, profitability, and market trends.

If you want, I can also make a **visually rich README layout** with icons, section dividers, and better formatting for **GitHub** so it looks professional like a portfolio project. That would make it presentation-ready.
